# MyRedisCLI
Python client library for [myredis](https://github.com/KrySeyt/myredis) written in C with Python wrapper. Compatible with original Redis

Why did I choose C and use workarounds for `asyncio` and [myasync](https://github.com/KrySeyt/myasync) for socket operations in C? Just for practice and fun. In any case, no one but me will use this library.

# Setup
Later =)
